Workaround for [Add support for injecting the Function provided ILogger into own DI Framework #2720](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/issues/2720#issuecomment-395816194) using `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`.

The logging factory available in `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host.Config.ExtensionConfigContext` has an `ILoggerFactory` that has certain filter applied that only allow logging for a few categories related to functions. This example uses reflection to add your own custom categories to those filters so you can use the existing loggers available when you run a function and inject `ILogger<>` instances in your custom code to do logging.
